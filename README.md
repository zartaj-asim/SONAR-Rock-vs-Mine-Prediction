# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting sonar signals as either "mine" (M) or "rock" (R) using logistic regression.

Dataset:

    The dataset used for this project is stored in sonar_data.csv. This file contains features extracted from sonar signals and  corresponding labels ('M' for mine and 'R' for rock).

Code: 
        The code to train the logistic regression model and evaluate its performance is provided in SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb. This Jupyter Notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics calculation, and visualization of results.

Model Training:

    Utilized Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn to train the model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:

    Calculated accuracy and generated a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance on the testing data.
    Computed precision, recall, and F1-score for both "M" and "R" classes to evaluate classification metrics.
